### Running on AWS using Terraform

The application is designed to be deployed on AWS using Terraform to provision the required infrastructure. Hereâ€™s an overview of the AWS services used and how Terraform manages them:

- **EC2**: Hosts the Flask web application.
- **RDS**: Manages the MySQL database for storing contact information.
- **Security Groups**: Ensure secure access to EC2 instances and RDS databases.
- **VPC**: Provides network isolation for the application.

#### Steps to Deploy on AWS:

1. **Install Terraform**:
   Ensure Terraform is installed on your local machine. You can follow the official [Terraform installation guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).

2. **AWS Configuration**:
   Set up your AWS credentials by running:
   \`\`\`bash
   aws configure
   \`\`\`

3. **Initialize Terraform**:
   Navigate to the directory containing the Terraform files and initialize Terraform:
   \`\`\`bash
   terraform init
   \`\`\`

4. **Apply Terraform Configuration**:
   Run the following command to provision the AWS infrastructure and deploy the application:
   \`\`\`bash
   terraform apply
   \`\`\`
   Confirm the actions when prompted.

5. **Access the Application**:
   Once Terraform finishes deploying, you can access the application using the public IP or DNS of the provisioned EC2 instance.

## Usage
